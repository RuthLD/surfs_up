üèÑ Analysis climate data for a business venture.
## Overview:
The goal of the analysis is to investigate the temperature trends for investors of a surf shop. The months of June and December are compared to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
## Results: 
Summary statistics were generated for June and December using all dates included in the dataset. It is not limited by year. The summary statistics for the recorded temperature, measured in degrees Farenhight can be seen in June_temp_stats.png and Dec_temp_stats.png.

* The green rectangle is the maximum amount of precipitation that occurred for any given day during the month.
  * December had a higher maximum amount of precipitation than June.
## Summary: 
The difference in the average temperature and the maximum recorded temperature for June and December are reasonably slight, so temperature fluctuations throughout the year should not negatively impact the business. The lowest recorded temperature difference may have a more considerable impact on the business during the winter months as there is a more significant fluctuation between the average and the lowest recorded temperature. 


One of the principal investor‚Äôs significant concerns is the amount of potential precipitation effect on the business. At the same time, June has more counts of precipitation than December because zero precipitation is numerically recorded in the dataset. December does have a higher maximum amount of precipitation than June and a higher standard deviation indicating it is more likely for there to be precipitation during December than June. This supports the earlier assessment that business may be impacted in the winter months.
